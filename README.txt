This game was created for the Arduino Uno system. It was created as a Computer Science project and was awarded first-class honours.

In order to run it, therefore, an Arduino Uno will be required (or an emulator).
However, statically examining the code should show some proficiency in C++.

Additionally, there is a video demonstration you can watch if you'd like.
