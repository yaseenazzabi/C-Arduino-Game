This game was created for the Arduino Uno system.

In order to run it, therefore, an Arduino Uno will be required.
However, examining the code should show some early proficiency in C++.

I am currently in the process of self-teaching this language, and will
update my resume with more involved programs in the future.

The arduino programming language is based on C++, as you will see upon
examing the code; for instance, this language implements pointers in the 
same way that C++ does.
